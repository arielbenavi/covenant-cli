You are a credit lawyer analyzing a credit agreement. Extract ALL covenant clauses related to liquidity timing and control.

**COVENANT TAXONOMY (from CLI Research Paper - Appendix Tables 4-6)**

The covenants are organized into 3 dimensions, each with specific covenant types listed IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE:

---
**DIMENSION E: EXIT ENGINEERING (Weight: 40%)**
Covenants that determine WHEN and HOW capital can exit. Extract these types:

1. **Call protection** - Prepayment premium or lock-out period (CRITICAL)
2. **Make-whole** - Fee equal to PV of forgone coupons
3. **Change-of-control put** - Mandatory prepayment at premium on ownership change
4. **Portability** - Debt allowed to remain post-sale under tests
5. **Mandatory redemption** - Asset sale or insurance proceeds repay debt
6. **Continuation/GP-led** - Pre-consented transfer to continuation vehicle
7. **Springing maturity** - Pulls maturity forward if other debt not refinanced
8. **Intercreditor release** - Defines when liens or guarantees drop

---
**DIMENSION O: OPTIONALITY STRUCTURING (Weight: 35%)**
Covenants that balance borrower flexibility and investor pacing. Extract these types:

1. **PIK toggle** - Option to accrue rather than pay cash interest (MOST CRITICAL)
2. **Accordion/incremental** - Ability to upsize existing facilities
3. **MFN/MFN sunset** - Keeps existing spreads within margin bands
4. **Equity kicker/warrants** - Lender participation in equity upside
5. **Amend/waiver thresholds** - Lender approval required to alter terms
6. **EBITDA add-backs** - Permitted profit adjustments for tests
7. **Cure rights (equity cure)** - Sponsor contribution to restore ratios
8. **Reclassification baskets** - Ability to shift capacity across baskets

---
**DIMENSION P: CASH-FLOW PACING (Weight: 25%)**
Covenants that regulate the rate and continuity of liquidity realization. Extract these types:

1. **Mandatory cash sweep** - Portion of excess cash automatically used to repay debt (CRITICAL)
2. **Restricted payments** - Limits dividends or distributions while debt remains
3. **Debt incurrence tests** - Conditions for issuing additional debt
4. **Maintenance covenants** - Ongoing leverage or coverage requirements
5. **NAV/LTV triggers** - Loan-to-value thresholds at fund level
6. **Distribution lock-up** - Suspends payouts under specified conditions
7. **Cash dominion/blocked account** - Lender control of receipts upon trigger
8. **Information rights** - Frequency and scope of borrower reporting
9. **Cross-default/acceleration** - Default elsewhere triggers default here
10. **Prepayment waterfall** - Order of application across tranches

---

**SCORING RULES (1-5 scale):**

**Exit Engineering Intensity:**
- 5: ≥3 years call protection + defined make-whole formula + tight portability
- 4: 2-3 years call protection + some premium + moderate terms
- 3: 1-2 years protection + basic change-of-control
- 2: <1 year protection + weak/discretionary exits
- 1: No call protection, unlimited prepayment flexibility

**Optionality Intensity (balance = higher score):**
- 5: Ratio-gated PIK with ≥100bps step-up + tight accordion/MFN (disciplined flexibility)
- 4: Some ratio gates or step-ups + moderate baskets
- 3: Discretionary toggles with limits + standard add-backs
- 2: Broad flexibility with few constraints + loose amendment thresholds
- 1: Unlimited optionality, no pacing discipline (covenant-lite)

**Cash-Flow Pacing Intensity:**
- 5: ≥75% ECF sweep + automatic trigger + quarterly NAV/LTV + distribution lock-up
- 4: 50-75% sweep + semi-annual tests + moderate restrictions
- 3: 50% sweep + annual tests + some maintenance covenants
- 2: <50% sweep + discretionary tests + weak restrictions
- 1: No cash sweep provisions, no maintenance covenants

---

**KEY SCORING NOTES:**
1. **PIK toggle** is the MOST IMPORTANT covenant in Optionality - if present, it should heavily influence the O score
2. **Call protection** and **Make-whole** are critical for Exit Engineering
3. **Mandatory cash sweep** is critical for Cash-Flow Pacing
4. Within each dimension, weight covenant types by their order in the list above (earlier = more important)
5. Look for NUMERIC VALUES: years, percentages, basis points, ratios - these determine intensity

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return a JSON array with each covenant as an object:

[
  {{
    "dimension": "E" | "O" | "P",
    "covenant_type": "call_protection" | "PIK_toggle" | "mandatory_cash_sweep" | etc.,
    "text": "exact quoted text from agreement (200-500 chars)",
    "section_reference": "Section X.X or page number",
    "intensity_score": 1-5,
    "intensity_rationale": "specific numbers: X years, Y%, Z bps, ratio gates",
    "numeric_values": {{
      "years": X,
      "percentage": Y,
      "basis_points": Z,
      "ratio": "X.Xx"
    }}
  }}
]

**EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Read the ENTIRE agreement - covenants appear in Articles 4-8 typically
2. For EACH covenant type listed above, search for it specifically
3. Extract the EXACT text (quote directly, 200-500 chars)
4. Identify NUMERIC parameters (years, %, bps, ratios)
5. Score 1-5 based on the numeric values and rules above
6. Aim for 15-25 covenants per document (not all types will be present)
7. If a covenant type is ABSENT, do not include it (absence = weak structure)
8. Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text
